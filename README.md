## DAY 113 (September 16, 2022 - January 6, 2023)
This is a dataset that describes daily estimates of statistics regarding the 2022 Iran protests.

All data are official estimates from the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) that have been compiled and structured by myself. However, there are many significant figures claimed by various media outlets that have not been taken into account by HRANA due to a lack of sufficient details, so the **ACTUAL NUMBERS** are **LIKELY TO BE HIGHER.**

## Data Sources
##### The primary data source used was the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), an organization that has covered the 2022 Iran protests extensively since its inception. HRANA has attempted to compile countless individual, group, media, and government reports to make rough statistical estimates, something no other public organization has done so far.

1. [HRANA's English Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/HRANA_English) - HRANA published daily updates in English since 10/16/22 on their Twitter, but several days' worth of data was skipped (primarily during early December 2022). 
2. [HRANA's Persian Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/hra.news/?hl=en) - HRANA published daily updates in Persian since 10/12/22 on their Instagram, and at a rate far more consistent than HRANA's English Twitter account. I used Google Translate's image scan to read the Persian graphics with the missing data I needed. 
3. [HRANA's "A Comprehensive Report of the First 82 Days of Nationwide Protests in Iran"](https://www.en-hrana.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/82-Day-WLF-Protest-in-Iran-2022-English.pdf) - Since HRANA's daily statistical updates only began after 10/12/22, there was no data for the first 25 days of the Iran protests. To fill in the missing values, I referenced HRANA's comprehensive report on the first 82 days of the protests to manually tally missing figures using the dates provided. 
4. [HRANA's "Woman, Life, Freedom; Comprehensive Report of 20 Days of Protest Across Iran"](https://www.en-hrana.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mahsa-Amini-20-Days-of-protests-Englisht.pdf) - HRANA's comprehensive report on the first 82 days of the protests tended to focus on the data as a whole. However, HRANA's report on the first 20 days were far more analytical and provided data visualizations that allowed me to properly deduce the rest of the missing values.

I took much inspiration with the formatting of my Kaggle dataset from Petro Ivaniuk's dataset about the [2022 Russia Ukraine War](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war), kudos to him!
